# QS University Ranking Analysis

This project investigates the QS university ranking methodology by testing whether the published factor weights (employability, research output, student–faculty ratio, international students, etc.) align with real-world data. Using a linear regression model on available university data, the project estimates factor contributions and compares them to the official QS weights, while noting limitations due to missing factors in the dataset.

## Methodology

The official QS ranking methodology can be found here: [QS Ranking Methodology](https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/methodology)

## Dataset
